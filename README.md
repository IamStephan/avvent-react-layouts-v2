## Install
**npm**
```bas
npm install --save @avvent/react-layouts styled-components@^5.0.0 deepmerge@^4.2.2
```

**yarn**
```bas
yarn add @avvent/react-layouts styled-components@^5.0.0 deepmerge@^4.2.2
```

## Breakpoints (Responsive design)
Breakpoints are used by the layout components to determine how the layout should look or behave depending on the device screen size.

> They are also used by  smart props to behave as indented.

**Default breakpoints**

| Name    | Value  |
| :------ | :----: |
| phone   | `425`  |
| tablet  | `768`  |
| laptop  | `1024` |
| desktop | `1440` |

```js
[
  { phone: 425 },
  { tablet: 768 },
  { laptop: 1024 },
  { desktop: 1440 }
]
```

Default breakpoints can be custom (More can be added, removed or changed).

> **NOTE:** All breakpoints apply max-width media query.

### Smart Props

Smart props are used by both the layout components and the box component. They align with the breakpoints defined on the components and follow a `prop-breakpoint` syntax.

Each component will have smart props and will be indicated in their documentation.

> **NOTE:** Props will be ignored if not supplied.
