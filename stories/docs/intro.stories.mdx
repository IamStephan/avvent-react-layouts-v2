**Yarn**
```bas
yarn add @avvent/react-layouts styled-components@^5.0.0
```

**npm**
```bas
npm --save @avvent/react-layouts styled-components@^5.0.0
```

> Don't worry. You won't be using styled component unless you want to. Its just there to make the code workðŸ˜Ž.

# Getting Acquainted
## Layout components
Layout components are used as parent components for your layout. They are **required** to have a `box component(s)` as a child(ren). Currently there is only layout component:
* Flexbox grid

> ### Layouts we wish to include:
> * CSS Grid
> * Float layout
> * (HTML) Table-based Layout
> * Masonry Grid
>
> NOTE: We are aware that the first two layouts are seen as something that should be avoided, if possible, but we have a few plans for themðŸ˜‰.

## Box Component


> The reason a box component has to be a child of a layout component is because the layout parent passes some props directly to its children (Flexbox does this especially, since most of the layouts is actually done by the Flex item and not parent)


## Nested grids.
You can use nested grids as long as they are inside a box component.

## Smart props
Each component will have a documented set of smart props you can use.
Essentially they are props that align with the breakpoints defined (either the default or your own).
They follow a `prop-breakpoint` syntax.
